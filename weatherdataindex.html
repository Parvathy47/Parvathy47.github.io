		<body><h1>Context</h1>
			<h3>This dataset contains daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.

The target RainTomorrow means: Did it rain the next day? Yes or No.

Note: You should exclude the variable Risk-MM when training your binary classification model. If you don't exclude it, you will leak the answers to your model and reduce its predictability. </h3>
			
			<h1>Content</h1>
			<h3><ol>
<li>Date:The date of observation<li>
<li>Location:The common name of the location of the weather station<li>
<li>MinTemp:The minimum temperature in degrees celsius<li>
<li>MaxTemp:The maximum temperature in degrees celsius<li>
<li>Rainfall:The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm<li>
<li>Evaporation:The so-called Class A pan evaporation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am<li>
<li>Sunshine:The number of hours of bright sunshine in the day.<li>
<li>WindGustDir:The direction of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight<li>
<li>WindGustSpeed:The speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight<li>
<li>WindDir9am:Direction of the wind at 9am<li>
<li>WindDir3pm:Direction of the wind at 3pm<li>
<li>WindSpeed9am:Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 9am<li>
<li>WindSpeed3pm:Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 3pm<li>
<li>Humidity9am:Humidity (percent) at 9am<li>
<li>Humidity3pm:Humidity (percent) at 3pm<li>
<li>Pressure9am:Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 9am<li>
<li>Pressure3pm:Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 3pm<li>
<li>Cloud9am:Fraction of sky obscured by cloud at 9am. This is measured in "oktas", which are a unit of eigths. It records how many eigths of the sky are obscured by cloud. A 0 measure indicates completely clear sky whilst an 8 indicates that it is completely overcast.<li>
<li>Cloud3pm:Fraction of sky obscured by cloud (in "oktas": eighths) at 3pm. See Cload9am for a description of the values<li>
<li>Temp9am:Temperature (degrees C) at 9am<li>
<li>Temp3pm:Temperature (degrees C) at 3pm<li>
<li>RainToday:Boolean: 1 if precipitation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am exceeds 1mm, otherwise 0<li>
<li>RISK_MM:The amount of rain. A kind of measure of the "risk".<li>
<li>RainTomorrow:The target variable. Did it rain tomorrow?</li></ol></h3>
